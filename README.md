### Hi. I am Rohan Marar. 


-    I'm an AI engineer. I like to think of myself as the Algorithmic Alchemist: someone who treats AI, math and code as tools to solve mysteries, find hidden patterns, and build cool apps by trying out new recipes.
-    I'm an avid fan of theoretical modern physics, including general relativity and quantum mechanics.
-    My ambition is to use my knowledge to create new revolutionary technology in future.
